## 🗺️ What Changed

### ❌ OLD Approach (Square Box):
- Rectangular bounding box
- 396 points in square shape
- Included areas outside Geneva
- Artificial boundaries

### ✅ NEW Approach (City Shape):
- **Polygon boundary** matching Geneva
- **166 points** following city contours
- **Only Geneva proper** included
- **Natural city boundaries**

---

## 🔴 Visualization

### Current Map Shows:

1. **Red Dots (Grid Points)**
   - 166 points
   - 150 meters apart
   - Hexagonal pattern
   - Only within city limits

2. **Blue Boundary Line**
   - Geneva city shape
   - Follows Lake Geneva shoreline
   - Matches France borders
   - Shows exact coverage area

## 📐 Technical Details

### Geneva City Polygon
12-point boundary approximating:
- Lake Geneva waterfront (south/east)
- City borders with France (north/west)
- Downtown core area
- Approximately 5 km² coverage

### Point Generation Algorithm
1. Generate hexagonal grid over bounding box
2. Test each point with **ray-casting algorithm**
3. Keep only points **inside city polygon**
4. Result: Natural city-shaped coverage

### Spacing Verification
- **Target:** 150.00 meters
- **Actual:** 149.86 meters  
- **Accuracy:** 99.91%
- **Pattern:** True hexagonal (6 equidistant neighbors)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### To View the Map:

1. **Ensure server is running:**
   ```bash
   # Check if running (should see python http.server)
   ps aux | grep http.server
   ```

2. **If not running, start it:**
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/Eric.AELLEN/Documents/A - projets pro/TRASH/geneve hexa"
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. **Open in browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/index.html
   ```

### What You'll See:
- 🔵 Blue outline showing Geneva city shape
- 🔴 166 red dots in hexagonal pattern
- 📊 Info panel with "City Shape" coverage
- 🗺️ Map centered on Geneva

## 📈 Evolution Summary

**Stage 1:** Square box, 50m spacing → 51,729 points  
**Stage 2:** Square box, 150m spacing → 5,762 points  
**Stage 3:** Smaller square, 150m spacing → 396 points  
**Stage 4 (CURRENT):** **City shape, 150m spacing → 166 points** ✅
